5. Basic Malware Scanner (Still in Development)

WARNING: The malware scan feature is a basic, heuristic-based tool and is still under development. This is NOT a professional malware scanner! Be careful when using it and always double-check any suspicious results before acting on them.


The malware scan checks for files and running processes that match common malware-related keywords (e.g., "trojan," "malware," "adware," "spyware," etc.).

You have the option to display only potentially malicious items or to see all items the tool scanned during its search.

IMPORTANT: This feature is still in its early stages and should not be relied on as a primary malware detection tool.
